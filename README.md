# Raiden Pico

A versatile glitching control platform built on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350), designed for hardware security research and fault injection experiments, written entirely by AI.

## Overview

Raiden Pico is a high-precision glitching tool that leverages the RP2350's PIO (Programmable I/O) state machines to generate precise glitch pulses for fault injection attacks. It supports multiple glitching methodologies including direct voltage glitching, ChipSHOUTER electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI), and clock glitching.

It was originally created as an experiment to see how useful AI could be in hardware hacking, but the goal has since evolved into making it the cheapest and most efficient glitching controller in order that it can be hardwired into test platforms to allow more reliable setups without having to waste or duplicate more expensive FPGA based controllers. 

All the code and test scripts in this project were written and tested by [Claude](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code)*

The inspiration for the project came from discussions here: [Prompt||GTFO](https://www.knostic.ai/blog/prompt-gtfo-season-1).

Full story in my [unprompted con talk "AI Go Beep Boop!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tqqnkemYsg).

\* Claude had full control of the Pico and a ChipShouter and was able to flash it and run against a real target. The only manual intervention required was validating timings etc. against an oscilloscope. I have not read a single line of code produced, only ran and tested it, so I cannot speak for the quality of the coding! YMMV!

### Key Features

- **Precise timing control**: PIO-based glitch generation with 6.67ns resolution (150 MHz system clock)
- **8 x Hardware UART**: Alternate configs are leveraged to share UART0/1 across multiple pinouts
- **Multiple trigger modes**: GPIO, UART byte matching, or software triggers
- **Glitch outputs**: Manual pulse output (GP2/GP7), ChipSHOUTER EMFI control (`CS` commands), and crowbar voltage glitching (EXTERNAL power mode, GP11)
- **Target support**: Built-in bootloader entry for LPC and STM32 microcontrollers
- **Command-line interface**: USB CDC serial interface with command shortcuts
- **GRBL XYZ support**: Direct UART control of GRBL CNC platform
- **SWD/JTAG debug**: Bit-banged SWD and JTAG for ARM target debugging, flash dumping, and RDP inspection
- **Real-time monitoring**: UART snooping for target debugging

## Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2** (RP2350)
- Target microcontroller
- Optional: ChipSHOUTER or voltage glitching hardware

## Installation

### Building from Source

```bash
# Set Pico SDK path
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk

# Ensure pico-sdk submodules are initialized
cd $PICO_SDK_PATH && git submodule update --init --recursive && cd -

# Build
./build.sh

# Optional: also expose the CLI on UART0 (GP0/GP1), in addition to USB.
# Lets the console travel through an external USB-UART bridge (e.g. the
# FaultyCat's `uart enter` passthrough on CH0/CH1 -> its CDC3).
# MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE with the ChipSHOUTER, which owns the same UART0/pins:
# with this option, chipshot_uart_{init,process}() are not called and the CS
# command refuses explicitly. `VERSION` reports which variant is on the chip.
cmake -S . -B build -DBOARD=pico2 -DRAIDEN_CONSOLE_UART=ON && make -C build -j

# Flash
# 1. Hold BOOTSEL button while plugging in USB
# 2. Copy UF2 file:
cp build/raiden_pico.uf2 /media/$USER/RP2350/
```

Once flashed, for future updates the FLASH target can be used with make:

```
make FLASH
```

### Quick Flash via CLI

Connect to the Pico and reboot to bootloader:
```bash
# Connect to CLI
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

# Reboot to bootloader
REBOOT BL

# Then copy the UF2 file to the mounted drive
```

### Hardware Reset via FTDI (optional but recommended)

If the firmware ever hangs and stops responding to `REBOOT BL`, you can
reset the Pico 2 from the host by wiring an FTDI breakout's DTR line to
the Pico 2's `EN` (RUN) pin (share GND too):

```
FTDI DTR  →  Pico 2 EN
FTDI GND  →  Pico 2 GND
```

Then pulse it from the host:
```bash
python3 scripts/reset_pico.py                          # default: /dev/ttyUSB0, 100ms
python3 scripts/reset_pico.py --wait                   # also confirm ttyACM0 comes back
python3 scripts/reset_pico.py --port /dev/ttyUSB1      # use a different FTDI port
python3 scripts/reset_pico.py --ms 200                 # longer reset pulse
python3 scripts/reset_pico.py --port /dev/ttyUSB1 --ms 200 --wait
```

Arguments:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--port <dev>` | `/dev/ttyUSB0` | FTDI serial device whose DTR pin is wired to EN |
| `--ms <n>`     | `100`          | DTR-low pulse duration in milliseconds |
| `--wait`       | off            | After resetting, wait for `/dev/ttyACM0` to enumerate and confirm with `VERSION` |

`PINS` in the CLI mentions this under "External Reset (suggested)".

## Usage

### Connecting

```bash
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
# or
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200
```

### Command Reference

All commands support non-ambiguous shortcuts (e.g., `STAT` for `STATUS`, `GL` for `GLITCH`, `TARG B` for `TARGET BOOTLOADER`).

#### API Mode (for scripting)

**`API [ON|OFF]`** - Enable/disable/show API mode
- Minimal output for script-friendly parsing
- Response format: `.` = received, `+` = success, `!` = failed

**`ERROR`** - Get last error message
- Returns the last error when a command fails in API mode

#### System Commands

**`HELP`** - Display command reference
- Shows all available commands with usage examples

**`STATUS`** - Show system status
- Displays chip variant, armed state, glitch parameters, trigger mode, and pin configuration

**`PINS`** - Show pin configuration
- Lists current GPIO assignments for glitch output, triggers, and power/target control

**`RESET`** - Reset system to default state
- Clears all configuration and returns to power-on defaults

**`REBOOT [BL]`** - Reboot the Pico
- `REBOOT` - Soft reboot (restart firmware)
- `REBOOT BL` - Reboot to bootloader mode for firmware updates

**`DEBUG [ON|OFF]`** - Toggle/show target UART debug display
- When enabled, displays all data received from target UART in real-time
- Useful for monitoring target behavior during glitching

#### Glitch Configuration

**`SET [PAUSE|WIDTH|GAP|COUNT] [<cycles>]`** - Set/show glitch parameters
- Values in system clock cycles @ 150MHz (6.67ns per cycle)
- Example: `SET WIDTH 150` = 1µs pulse
- With no value, shows current settings

**`GET [PAUSE|WIDTH|GAP|COUNT|VMIN]`** - Read current parameter values
- Query individual or all glitch parameters
- Example: `GET WIDTH`

**`SET VMIN <mV>`** - ADC-gated glitch-depth threshold (millivolts)
- **Wiring required:** the target's reference rail (e.g. JTAG `VTref`,
  the chip's VDD pin, or whichever rail you intend to monitor while
  glitching) must be wired to **GP26 (ADC0)**. Without that wire the
  CPU has nothing to gate on and the glitch will never reach its
  threshold. Verify with `ADC 0` — should return the target's idle
  voltage (or a divided version of it).
- `0` (default) = disabled. Glitches use the standard time-based PIO pulse
  defined by WIDTH/GAP/PAUSE/COUNT.
- Non-zero = enables **ADC-gated** glitching: instead of releasing the rail
  after a fixed time, the CPU polls ADC0 (GP26) during the drop and releases
  only once the probed voltage reaches the configured threshold. WIDTH is
  then re-interpreted as the *minimum dwell time past threshold* (in
  cycles ÷ 150 = µs), so the rail is held LOW for at least that long even
  after the ADC trips — useful for letting core decoupling caps drain
  further than the I/O rail.
- Example: `SET VMIN 500` `SET WIDTH 15000` → drop the rail until ADC reads
  ≤ 500 mV (probe-space), then hold for 100 µs before restoring.
- `SET WIDTH 0` → release the rail *immediately* once the ADC hits VMIN,
  no dwell. This is the right default for chips whose protection logic
  sits on a low-capacitance rail where dwell adds nothing useful (and
  for inrush-sensitive setups where the shorter time at LOW is safer
  for the Pico's GPIO sink pads).
- VMIN's depth control applies to commands that route through the
  CPU-side ADC primitive — currently `TARGET GLITCH LPCBYPASS` (and the
  STM32 sweep/test routines that already use ADC gating). PIO-driven
  triggers (UART/GPIO) still use WIDTH-only timed pulses until VMIN is
  wired into that path.
- See [VMIN.md](VMIN.md) for the math (RC time constants vs decoupling
  caps) and the cap-strip experimental procedure used to reach µs-scale
  transients from the GP10/11/12 sink path.

#### Trigger Configuration

**`TRIGGER [NONE|GPIO|UART]`** - Configure/show trigger

**`TRIGGER NONE`** - Disable all triggers
- Glitches can only be manually fired with `GLITCH` command

**`TRIGGER GPIO <RISING|FALLING>`** - Configure GPIO trigger on GP3
- Trigger on edge detection of GP3 (fixed pin)
- Example: `TRIGGER GPIO RISING`
- Use case: Trigger from external signal or target GPIO

**`TRIGGER UART <byte> [TX|RX]`** - Configure UART byte trigger
- Trigger when specific byte is seen on target UART
- Byte value in hex (0-FF)
- `TX` = sniff Raiden TX (GP4, bytes sent to target)
- `RX` = sniff Raiden RX (GP5, bytes received from target, default)
- Example: `TRIGGER UART 0D` (trigger on '\r' from target)
- Example: `TRIGGER UART EE TX` (trigger on 0xEE sent to target)
- PIO-based decoder works with 8N1, 8E1, or any parity mode

#### Glitch Execution

**`ARM [ON|OFF]`** - Arm/disarm/show glitch system
- Must be armed before glitches will fire on triggers
- Safety feature to prevent accidental glitching
- Example: `ARM ON`

**`GLITCH`** - Manually fire a single glitch
- Immediately generates glitch pulse(s)
- Works regardless of trigger configuration
- Useful for testing glitch parameters

#### Clock Generator

**`CLOCK [<freq>] [ON|OFF]`** - Set/get clock frequency and enable/disable
- Generates clock signal on GP6
- Example: `CLOCK 12000000 ON` (12MHz clock)
- Example: `CLOCK OFF` (disable clock)

#### ADC Trace (Shunt Current Capture)

Capture target power consumption via a shunt resistor on GP27/ADC1. Place a 1-10 ohm resistor in series with the target's VDD supply and connect GP27 across it (high side to ADC, low side to GND). A 10 ohm shunt gives good sensitivity for low-power targets like STM32F1 (~20-50mA); use 1 ohm for higher-current targets to stay within the ADC's 0-3.3V range. The ADC samples at ~500ksps (~2us/sample) into a circular DMA buffer, triggered by the same PIO trigger used for glitching. This allows profiling the target's current draw around security-critical operations like RDP checks.

**`TRACE [samples] [pre%]`** - Start ADC trace
- Default: 4096 samples, 50% pre-trigger
- Example: `TRACE 8192 25` (8192 samples, 25% pre-trigger)

**`TRACE STATUS`** - Check trace state (IDLE/RUNNING/COMPLETE)

**`TRACE DUMP`** - Dump raw ADC samples (hex, repeatable)
- Can be called multiple times without clearing buffer

**`TRACE RESET`** - Discard trace buffer and reset to IDLE

**`TRACE RATE <clkdiv>`** - Set ADC sample rate
- `clkdiv=0` (default): ~2us/sample (~500ksps), best for short captures
- `clkdiv=50`: ~100us/sample, for medium-range captures
- `clkdiv=500`: ~1ms/sample, for long-range captures (~4 seconds with 4096 samples)
- Example: `TRACE RATE 500` then `TRACE 4096 50` captures ~4s of data

**`ARM TRACE`** / **`TRACE ARM`** - Arm trigger for trace-only capture
- Like `ARM ON` but only captures ADC data, no glitch pulse generated
- Trigger fires GP22 which stops DMA capture

##### Workflow

```bash
# Configure trigger (e.g., UART byte match)
TRIGGER UART 79 RX

# Start trace buffer
TRACE 4096 50

# Arm for trace-only (no glitch output)
ARM TRACE

# Send command to target (triggers capture)
TARGET SEND 11EE

# Check and dump
TRACE STATUS
TRACE DUMP

# Clean up
ARM OFF
TRACE RESET
```

##### Dual Trace: Finding the Glitch Window

By running two traces with different trigger bytes, you can measure the exact time window between sending a command and receiving the response — the window during which the target executes security-critical code. Multiple runs with median averaging reject periodic noise (e.g., watchdog resets) while preserving the true power signature.

![Dual Trace Example](examples/dual_trace_stm32f1.png)

*Example: STM32F1 Read Memory command (15-run median). TX trace triggers on 0xEE (last command byte sent), RX trace triggers on 0x79 (ACK after rdp_check). The overlay shows the 98µs glitch window (14,700 Raiden cycles at 150MHz) between command and response — the interval where the RDP check executes. Top axis shows Raiden PIO cycles for direct use as the glitch PAUSE parameter.*

See [`scripts/stm32_dual_trace.py`](scripts/stm32_dual_trace.py) for the full automation script (multi-run median with power cycling), and [`scripts/stm32_single_trace.py`](scripts/stm32_single_trace.py) for single-trigger capture.

##### Periodic Artifact in Single-Run Traces

Single-run traces contain large periodic current dips (~every 4-5 seconds) unrelated to target code execution — they appear identically whether the STM32 core is running or halted via SWD. The source is unknown (possibly IWDG watchdog resets or USB power regulation). These dips corrupt single-run measurements and make cross-correlation alignment unreliable, which is why the dual trace script uses median averaging across multiple power-cycled runs to reject them.

![Periodic Artifact](examples/longrange_periodic_artifact.png)

*Long-range ADC capture (~43 seconds) showing the periodic artifact. These dips are 200-300mV deep and occur regardless of target execution state.*

#### Target Control

Raiden Pico includes built-in support for entering bootloader mode on common microcontrollers.

**`TARGET <LPC|LPC2|LPC17|STM32F1|STM32F3|STM32F4|STM32L4|BAT32>`** - Set target microcontroller type
- Configures bootloader entry protocol
- `LPC` - NXP LPC series (ISP protocol)
- `STM32` - STMicroelectronics STM32 series
- `BAT32` - Cmsemicon BAT32G135 (Cortex-M0+) — **read-only**: no UART ISP bootloader
  (undocumented on this part) and no flash write/erase path. Sets up the memory map for
  `SWD READ FLASH|SRAM` and enables the BAT32-specific decode in `SWD OPT`. See
  `SWD RACE` below for the reset-release race this target needs (its SW-DP does not
  answer while `RESETB` is held low, so `SWD CONNECTRST` does not work on it).

**`TARGET BOOTLOADER [baud] [crystal_khz]`** - Enter bootloader
- Initialize target UART and enter bootloader mode
- Defaults: 115200 baud, 12000 kHz crystal
- LPC example: `TARGET BOOTLOADER 115200 12000`
- STM32 example: `TARGET BOOTLOADER 115200`

**`TARGET SYNC [baud] [crystal_khz] [reset_delay_ms] [retries]`** - Reset and enter bootloader
- Performs target reset, waits, then enters bootloader
- Includes automatic retry logic for reliability
- Energises the target first, so no separate `TARGET POWER ON` is needed
- Defaults: 115200 baud, 12000 kHz crystal, 500ms reset delay, 5 retries
- Example: `TARGET SYNC 115200 12000 500 5`

**`TARGET SEND <hex|"text">`** - Send data to target
- Send hex bytes or quoted text to target UART
- Hex: `TARGET SEND 3F` (sends 0x3F)
- Text: `TARGET SEND "hello"` (automatically appends \r)

**`TARGET RESPONSE`** - Display target response buffer
- Shows data received from target UART
- Useful after sending bootloader commands

**`TARGET RESET [PERIOD <ms>] [PIN <n>] [HIGH]`** - Reset target
- Pulses reset pin to restart target
- Defaults: 300ms pulse, GPIO 15, active low
- Example: `TARGET RESET PERIOD 500 PIN 16 HIGH`

**`TARGET POWER [ON|OFF|CYCLE] [ms]`** - Control/show target power on GP10/11/12
- `ON` - Enable power
- `OFF` - Disable power
- `CYCLE` - Power cycle with optional duration (default: 300ms)
- In `EXTERNAL` mode these drive **GP10 only** (the supply enable); GP11/GP12 are not touched.
- **Boot default is OFF** (de-energized) in both modes. The target is powered on demand
  by `TARGET POWER ON`, or automatically by the auto-power-on at the `TARGET SYNC` /
  `SWD CONNECT` choke points. Scripts that drive the target without going through a choke
  point (e.g. `TARGET RESET`-only or JTAG flows) must issue `TARGET POWER ON` first.

**`TARGET POWER [INT|EXT [AHIGH|ALOW]]`** - Select how the GP10/11/12 group is driven
- `INT` (default) - GP10/11/12 ganged as the target power source/sink (current behaviour).
- `EXT` - GP10 = supply enable, **GP11 = crowbar gate** (PIO-driven, emits the same glitch
  waveform as GP2 for any trigger type), GP12 = reserved spare.
- `AHIGH` (default) - crowbar gate asserts HIGH, idle LOW (low-side N-FET).
- `ALOW` - crowbar gate asserts LOW, idle HIGH (high-side P-FET / active-low driver).
- Bare `TARGET POWER` prints the power on/off state, the current mode, and gate polarity. Disarm (`ARM OFF`)
  before switching. The CPU-side power-group glitch routines (`SWEEP`/`GLITCH`/`PAYLOAD`/
  `BYPASS`/LPC bypass) are refused in `EXT` mode — use the PIO crowbar (`ARM` + trigger).

**`TARGET GLITCH SWEEP`** - Calibrate voltage glitch threshold
- Ramps target power down via ADC monitoring to find brown-out reset voltage
- Required before PAYLOAD or BYPASS commands

**`TARGET GLITCH TEST <voltage> [count]`** - Power glitch attack
- Glitch target power to specified voltage threshold
- Default: 1 attempt

**`TARGET GLITCH PAYLOAD <voltage> [attempts]`** - Glitch with bootloader re-entry
- Power glitch then re-enter bootloader to check for ISP code readout bypass

**`TARGET GLITCH BYPASS [attempts] [count]`** - RDP1 flash dump via FPB redirect [STM32F1]
- Two-stage attack: POR glitch → FPB redirect → UART flash dump at 115200 baud
- Default: 20 attempts, full flash size
- See [STM32F1 RDP1 Bypass Workflow](#4-stm32f1-rdp1-bypass) below

**`TARGET TIMEOUT [<ms>]`** - Get/set transparent bridge timeout
- Default: 50ms

#### ChipSHOUTER Control

Built-in UART control for NewAE ChipSHOUTER EMFI tool.

**`CS ARM`** - Arm ChipSHOUTER
- Prepares ChipSHOUTER for firing
- Required before pulses can be generated

**`CS DISARM`** - Disarm ChipSHOUTER
- Safety disarm ChipSHOUTER
- Prevents accidental pulses

**`CS FIRE`** - Manually fire ChipSHOUTER

- Example: `CS VOLTAGE 250`

**`CS PULSE [<80-1000>]`** - Set/get ChipSHOUTER pulse width (ns)
- Configure pulse duration in ns; valid range 80-1000 (out-of-range is rejected)
- Ignored in HW-trigger mode (the output follows the GP2 trigger pulse width)
- Example: `CS PULSE 160`

**`CS TRIGGER HW <HIGH|LOW>`** - Set hardware trigger mode
- Configures ChipSHOUTER to trigger on glitch output pin
- `HIGH` - Active high trigger (pin idles low with pull-down)
- `LOW` - Active low trigger (pin idles high with pull-up)
- Example: `CS TRIGGER HW HIGH`

**`CS TRIGGER SW`** - Set software trigger mode
- ChipSHOUTER fires when interrupt routine calls `CS FIRE`
- Disables hardware trigger input

**`CS RESET`** - Reset ChipSHOUTER
- Clears errors and reinitializes ChipSHOUTER

**`CS HVOUT`** - Get ChipSHOUTER HV output status
- Query high voltage output state

#### SWD Debug Interface

SWD (Serial Wire Debug) for ARM Cortex-M targets, over two selectable physical
layers (`SWD PHY`, default bit-banged GPIO): supports connecting, reading/writing
registers and memory, STM32-specific operations like RDP readout and option byte
inspection, and read-only BAT32G135 option-byte decoding.

**`SWD PHY [BITBANG|PIO [<khz>]]`** - Get/set the physical layer
- `BITBANG` (default): the original bit-banged GPIO driver, timed by `SWD SPEED`.
  `SPEED 0` (max) mis-samples on a flying-wire bench with no series resistors —
  `ACK=0x7` and a `DPIDR` shifted left by one bit, indistinguishable on the
  surface from a genuinely SWD-disabled target. Slow down (`SPEED 1-8`) before
  concluding a target is protected. See §0bis of `07_BAT32G135_FAULTYCAT.md`.
- `PIO`: PIO2 SM0, adapted from [raspberrypi/debugprobe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe)'s
  `probe.pio` (MIT license) — uniform, correctly-sampled edges at a chosen
  frequency, no `SPEED 0` failure mode. Required by `SWD RACE` (see below).
  `<khz>` is required the first time PIO is selected; omit it later to reuse
  the last frequency. Switching either direction forces a reconnect.
- PIO2 is otherwise unused by this firmware (PIO0/PIO1 are both saturated by
  the glitch engine) — the split is `swd.c` (protocol) / `swd_phy.c` +
  `swd_phy.pio` (PIO2 physical layer) / `swd.c`'s bit-bang fallback.

**`SWD BENCH`** - Time a fast connect + AHB-AP bring-up + 2-word read
- The same sequence `SWD RACE` runs on each attempt, without touching nRST —
  a before/after measurement of what a physical-layer or speed change actually
  bought. Reports elapsed microseconds at whatever `SWD PHY`/`SWD SPEED` is
  currently active, **broken down by phase** (`connect=` line reset +
  JTAG-to-SWD + DPIDR, `ahb=` power-up handshake + AP probe, `read=` CSW/TAR
  + the DRW reads). The split exists because a whole-number total sent an
  earlier optimisation attempt after the wrong thing twice — measure the
  phases before theorising.
- Measured on a BAT32G135 (v0.10): BITBANG `SPEED 4` 8 755 us · PIO 2500 kHz
  531 us · PIO 8000 kHz 249 us (connect 87 / ahb 91 / read 71).
- Like every other `SWD` command, it leaves the target connected afterward
  (debug domain powered, AHB-AP up) — it's a timing probe, not read-only.

**`SWD CONNECT`** - Connect to target via SWD
- Performs line reset + JTAG-to-SWD switch sequence
- Reads and displays DPIDR on success
- Energises the target first (SWD READ/WRITE/HALT auto-connect and do the same), so no separate `TARGET POWER ON` is needed

**`SWD CONNECTRST`** - Connect under reset
- Holds nRST, connects via SWD, halts core, releases nRST
- Required for modifying option bytes on RDP-protected targets
- Needs the target's SW-DP to still answer *while nRST is held low* — some parts
  (e.g. BAT32G135: SWDIO/SWCLK are high-impedance during an external reset or POR,
  per its user manual) don't. For those, use `SWD RACE` instead — same goal, opposite
  timing: it releases nRST *first*, then races to connect.

**`SWD RACE [<delay_us>]`** - Reset-release race
- Asserts nRST, releases it, waits **exactly** `delay_us` (no clamping, no implicit
  compensation), then races to connect + bring up the AHB-AP + read the reset vector
  (`0x00000000`) before the target's own firmware can lock SWD (e.g. by writing a
  runtime SWD-disable bit — `DBGSTOPCR.SWDIS` on the BAT32G135). This is a pure
  timing race, not a fault injection.
- Requires `SWD PHY PIO` first (v0.10+). Bit-banged clocking — at any `SWD SPEED`,
  including 0 (see `SWD PHY` above) — either dwarfs the race window or mis-samples
  it outright.
- Prints one of `no_dp` / `dp_only` / `mem_blocked` / `perturbed` / `SUCCESS`. The
  `SUCCESS` plausibility check (SP inside the target's SRAM, PC inside its code
  flash with the Thumb bit set) only activates when `TARGET BAT32` is selected —
  otherwise every non-blocked read reports `perturbed`.
- On `SUCCESS` the target is left **powered and connected** — dump immediately
  (`SWD READ FLASH ...`), don't reset or power-cycle first (Level 0 on the
  BAT32G135 does not survive the next reset).

**`SWD RACE SWEEP <start_us> <end_us> <step_us> [SHOTS <n>]`** - Sweep the race delay
- Bounded to 200000 delay points x 1000 shots; stops immediately on the first
  `SUCCESS` (see above); aborts on any pending keypress. Prints throttled progress
  and a final summary. Example: `SWD RACE SWEEP 0 2000 1 SHOTS 3`.

**`SWD IDCODE`** - Identify connected target
- Reads DPIDR, CPUID, and STM32 debug ID code
- Decodes ARM part number and STM32 device variant

**`SWD HALT`** / **`SWD RESUME`** - Halt/resume target core
- Uses DHCSR debug register to control execution
- Required before register reads or SRAM writes

**`SWD REGS`** - Read core registers
- Displays r0-r15, xPSR, MSP, PSP while halted

**`SWD FILL <addr|region> <value> [n] [ERASE]`** - Fill memory with pattern
- Fills n words (default: full region for aliases, 1 for raw address)
- Flash addresses auto-detected — requires ERASE keyword to confirm page erase
- Examples: `SWD FILL SRAM DEADBEEF 16`, `SWD FILL 08000000 CAFEF00D 8 ERASE`

**`SWD FLASH ERASE <page>`** - Erase a flash page
- STM32 only — under `TARGET BAT32` it redirects to `SWD BAT32` (below), whose
  flash controller sequence is transcribed from the vendor driver

**`SWD BAT32 <op> ...`** - BAT32G135 flash controller (writes need `CONFIRM`)
- `PROGRAM <addr> <byte> CONFIRM` · `WRITE <addr> <hex> CONFIRM` (256 B max) ·
  `PATTERN <addr> <len> CONFIRM` (blank pages only) · `ARM CONFIRM` (OCDEN →
  0xC3 = protection Level 1) · `DISARM CONFIRM` · `CHIPERASE CONFIRM` ·
  `SECTORERASE <addr> CONFIRM`
- Programming clears bits only (1→0); going 0→1 needs an erase
- ★ **`CHIPERASE` erases the code flash only.** Measured 2026-09-02: after a
  chip erase reporting success, the data flash at `0x500000` was byte-identical
  to its pre-erase content. Aiming the trigger write at `0x500000` changes
  nothing — that array is outside `FLERMD=0x08`. Consequence: **escaping Level 1
  by chip erase preserves the data flash**, pairing included.
- ★ **`SECTORERASE` is the only way to blank the data flash** (vendor
  `FLERMD=0x10`). `<addr>` = any address in the sector. The data-flash sector is
  **512 bytes**, so the 1.5 KB array takes three: `0x500000`, `0x500200`,
  `0x500400`.

**`SWD BAT32 RAMREAD <addr> [words]`** - Read flash **through the target core**
- The Level 1 bypass: at Level 1 the *debugger* may not read flash, but the core
  may — it executes from it. This halts the core, drops a 16-byte Thumb copier
  into SRAM at `0x20000000`, points `PC` at it with `r0`=source,
  `r1`=`0x20000020`, `r2`=word count, resumes, and reads the buffer back once
  the trailing `BKPT` re-halts the core.
- Word-aligned address; 1-1024 words (4 KB) per pass, default 4
- Read-only on flash, so no `CONFIRM` — but it **overwrites target SRAM
  `0x20000000-0x2000101F`**, which is where `.data` copied from flash at boot
  lives. At Level 1, dump SRAM *before* the first `RAMREAD`.
- Validated at Level 0: 64 KB of code flash and 1.5 KB of data flash come back
  byte-identical to `SWD READ` (35 s for the RAMREAD pass alone at `SWD SPEED
  4`; 70 s for the two-path comparison, `scripts/bat32_ramread_compare.py`).
  **Not yet tried at Level 1**, which is the only case it exists for.
- A failure says which step failed — SRAM not writable, register write refused,
  core locked up, or halted somewhere other than the payload's `BKPT`

**`SWD OPT`** - Read option bytes
- Displays all option registers for the selected STM32 family
- Under `TARGET BAT32`: decodes `OCDEN`/`OCDM`/`BTEN` (both option-byte clusters,
  including the boot-swap mirror) and `DBGSTOPCR.SWDIS`, and prints the deduced
  protection level (Level 0/1/2, per the official OCDEN/OCDM truth table)

**`SWD RDP`** - Read RDP (readout protection) level
- Requires TARGET set to an STM32 family — refused under `TARGET BAT32` (it has no
  RDP register; its protection model is the OCDEN/OCDM option bytes, use `SWD OPT`)
- Returns level 0, 1, or 2

**`SWD RDP SET <0|1>`** - Set RDP level
- Setting to 0 triggers mass erase on most families
- Level 2 is refused (permanent and irreversible)

**`SWD READ <addr> [n]`** - Read memory (hex dump format)
**`SWD READ FLASH|SRAM|BOOTROM [n]`** - Read memory region (default: full)
**`SWD READ DP|AP <addr>`** - Read debug/access port register
- Examples: `SWD READ SRAM`, `SWD READ 20000000 16`, `SWD READ FLASH 64`

**`SWD REGS`** - Read core registers
- Displays r0-r15, xPSR, MSP, PSP while halted

**`SWD RESET`** - Pulse nRST for 100ms
**`SWD RESET HOLD`** - Assert nRST (hold target in reset)
**`SWD RESET RELEASE`** - Release nRST

**`SWD WRITE <addr> <value> [ERASE]`** - Write memory with auto-verify
**`SWD WRITE FLASH|SRAM <value> [ERASE]`** - Write to region base address
**`SWD WRITE DP|AP <addr> <value>`** - Write debug/access port register
- All writes read back and verify
- Flash addresses auto-detected — requires ERASE keyword to confirm page erase

#### JTAG Debug Interface

Bit-banged JTAG for scanning and identifying devices. Shares clock and data pins with SWD (active one at a time).

**`JTAG RESET`** - Reset TAP state machine
- Drives TMS high for 5+ clocks to reach Test-Logic-Reset

**`JTAG IDCODE`** - Read device IDCODE
- Resets TAP and shifts out 32-bit IDCODE from DR

**`JTAG SCAN`** - Scan chain for devices
- Detects number of devices and reads their IDCODEs

**`JTAG IR <value> [bits]`** - Shift instruction register
- Default: 4 bits

**`JTAG DR <value> [bits]`** - Shift data register
- Default: 32 bits

#### GRBL XY Platform Control

Built-in UART control for GRBL-based XY positioning platforms (CNC routers, laser cutters, etc.) useful for automated EMFI probe positioning.

**Note**: The system uses UART1 for both Target (GP4/GP5) and GRBL (GP8/GP9). Only one can be active at a time - switching between them reconfigures the UART automatically.

**`GRBL SEND <gcode>`** - Send raw G-code command
- Send any G-code directly to GRBL controller
- Example: `GRBL SEND G0 X10 Y10`

**`GRBL UNLOCK`** - Unlock alarm state
- Sends `$X` to clear GRBL alarm
- Enables movement without requiring homing

**`GRBL SET HOME`** - Set current position as home
- Sets current XY position as origin (0,0,0)
- Sends `G92 X0 Y0 Z0`

**`GRBL HOME [timeout_ms]`** - Move to home position
- Synchronous move to (0,0) coordinates
- Default timeout: 30000ms

**`GRBL AUTOHOME [timeout_ms]`** - Auto-home with limit switches
- Sends `$H` to trigger GRBL's homing cycle
- Requires limit switches configured on GRBL controller
- Default timeout: 60000ms

**`GRBL MOVE <X> <Y> [F] [timeout_ms]`** - Move to absolute position
- Synchronous move to specified XY coordinates
- Optional feed rate in mm/min (default: 300)
- Example: `GRBL MOVE 15 20` or `GRBL MOVE 15 20 500`

**`GRBL STEP <DX> <DY> [F] [timeout_ms]`** - Move relative distance
- Synchronous move by specified offset from current position
- Optional feed rate in mm/min (default: 300)
- Example: `GRBL STEP 5 -3` (move +5mm X, -3mm Y)

**`GRBL POS`** - Get current position
- Query current XYZ coordinates from GRBL
- Returns position in machine coordinates

**`GRBL RESET`** - Soft reset GRBL
- Sends Ctrl-X (0x18) to reset GRBL controller
- Use to recover from error states

```

### 4. STM32F1 RDP1 Bypass

Extract flash from an RDP Level 1 protected STM32F103 using voltage fault injection and FPB (Flash Patch and Breakpoint) redirect.

This attack is based on the original [stimpik](https://github.com/xobs/stimpik) research by Sean Cross (xobs), which demonstrated STM32F1 RDP bypass via voltage fault injection to achieve SRAM boot with memory retention. Raiden Pico's implementation improves on this by replacing the non-deterministic timing-based glitch (which requires many random attempts to hit the right moment) with a **deterministic approach** based on known ARM Cortex-M brown-out reset (BOR) behaviour at specific voltage thresholds. The `TARGET GLITCH SWEEP` command characterises the target's exact BOR threshold and SRAM retention window, meaning the subsequent attack glitch is calibrated to land in the proven-working voltage range every time — typically succeeding on the first attempt.

#### Tuning

If `TARGET GLITCH SWEEP` shows nRST being triggered at every threshold but no SRAM retention (all reads fail), the power rail capacitance is too low — the voltage drops below the BOR threshold too quickly for SRAM to retain its contents. Add decoupling capacitors (10-100µF) across the target VDD/GND to slow the voltage decay. Conversely, if nRST never triggers, the capacitance is too high and the voltage doesn't drop fast enough — reduce or remove external capacitors on VDD. The goal is a sweep that shows a range of thresholds where nRST fires AND SRAM contents are fully retained.

A healthy sweep on a well-decoupled STM32F103 looks like this — nRST fires at every threshold, SRAM is fully retained down to ~0.81V, and the BOR floor is found at ~0.76V where the first retention failure appears:

```
=== SRAM Retention Sweep Summary ===

BOR threshold: ~0.76V

Calibration saved: optimal threshold=0.81V
```

The saved threshold (0.81V — the lowest still-retaining row) is what gets passed automatically to `TARGET GLITCH BYPASS`/`PAYLOAD` for the attack glitch.

#### Wiring

| Pico GPIO | STM32 Pin | Function |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| GP4 | PA10 (USART1 RX) | Bootloader/bypass TX |
| GP5 | PA9 (USART1 TX) | Bypass RX (flash dump data) |
| GP10/11/12 | VDD | Target power (ganged for current) |
| GP13 | BOOT0 | Boot mode select |
| GP14 | BOOT1 | Boot mode select |
| GP15 | nRST | Reset control |
| GP17 | SWCLK | SWD clock (payload upload) |
| GP18 | SWDIO | SWD data (payload upload) |
| GP26 | VDD | ADC voltage monitor (via divider) |
| GND | GND | Common ground |

GP15/17/18 are SIO (plain GPIO) by default; when `SWD PHY PIO` is active, GP17/18
are PIO2 SM0-driven continuously, and GP15 is briefly PIO2 SM1-driven only for the
duration of an `SWD RACE` attempt (SIO the rest of the time) — see `SWD PHY` above.

#### How it works

1. **Calibrate**: `TARGET GLITCH SWEEP` ramps power down to find the brown-out reset (BOR) threshold voltage
2. **Upload**: Payload is written to SRAM via SWD — contains a NOP sled, FPB configuration (stage 1), and UART flash dump code (stage 2)
3. **BOOT0=HIGH, POR glitch**: Power is cut below BOR threshold then restored. The glitch causes a power-on reset while BOOT0 is held high, forcing SRAM boot. The NOP sled catches all possible SRAM entry points
4. **Stage 1**: Code configures FPB to redirect the reset vector fetch (address 0x04) to a remap table in SRAM containing stage 2's address, then signals ready via LED
5. **BOOT0=LOW, nRST pulse**: Pico sets BOOT0 low and pulses nRST. CPU resets into flash boot mode — RDP sees flash boot and allows flash reads. But FPB (preserved across reset) redirects the reset vector fetch to stage 2 in SRAM
6. **Stage 2**: Sends `RDP1` header + CPUID + continuous flash contents over USART1 at 115200 baud
7. **Capture**: Pico receives the requested number of bytes, then power cycles the target to stop the dump

#### Commands

```bash
# Check RDP level (should show Level 1)
SWD RDP

# Calibrate glitch threshold
TARGET GLITCH SWEEP

# Full flash dump (128KB for F103)
TARGET GLITCH BYPASS

# Partial dump (first 256 bytes, up to 50 attempts)
TARGET GLITCH BYPASS 50 256
```

## Heatmap Visualization Tools

The project includes Python scripts for automated XY scanning with real-time heatmap visualization.

[![Heatmap Screenshot](examples/heatmap_screenshot.png)](examples/heatmap_example.html)

### Live Heatmap (`glitch_heatmap.py`)

Run automated EM-glitch scans of a CRP-protected target with live web-based
visualization. The script drives the XY platform (Grbl), the ChipSHOUTER,
and the Pico glitcher in lockstep — each cell of the grid is hit with one
or more EM pulses while the target attempts an ISP read of flash. Each
shot's response is classified:

- **`normal`** — target replied with `rc=19 / CODE_READ_PROTECTION_ENABLED`.
  CRP held; glitch missed.
- **`effect`** — target perturbed: no reply, garbled reply, or any other
  unexpected error. The target was disrupted but CRP wasn't bypassed.
- **`glitch`** — target replied with real flash content (the BL READ
  succeeded). **CRP bypassed!** In the default dump mode the full flash
  range is saved to `dump_<ts>_x<X>_y<Y>_v<V>.bin` immediately, since the
  bypass may not repeat on the next attempt.

```bash
# Basic scan (25x25 grid, full window, default quickmap mode)
python3 glitch_heatmap.py

# Focused 5x5 window with 10 confirms per voltage
python3 glitch_heatmap.py --start 8 11 --end 12 15 --shots 10

# Reverse spiral starting from center
python3 glitch_heatmap.py --reverse --start-x 12 --start-y 12
```

Open http://localhost:8080 for the live UI:

- **Hit Rate grid**: green (0%) → red (100%), blue cell for any landed
  glitch.
- **Voltage grid**: dark blue (0 V) → red (500 V). In quickmap mode this is
  the settle voltage (lower = chip is more sensitive at this cell).
- **Left side bar**: shot count for the active cell (fills bottom→top).
- **Right side bar**: live CS voltage (fills bottom→top, shrinks if the
  voltage drops during a sweep).
- **Hover any cell** for tested-cell stats or live `IN PROGRESS` numbers
  on the active cell (shots done, running hit rate, current voltage, any
  glitch landings so far).

#### Scan modes

The script supports three scan strategies. Pick the one matching what
you're trying to learn about the target:

| Mode | Flag | What it does | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quickmap** | *(default)* | At each position, drop the CS voltage by `CS_VOLTAGE_STEP` on the **first non-normal shot**. Re-test at the lower voltage. Position "settles" once we get `--confirm N` consecutive normals at one voltage, capped by `--shots N` total shots across all voltage levels. Each position always restarts at `CS_VOLTAGE` (500 V) so cells are mapped independently — no neighbour bias. | Quick exploration to find which positions are sensitive and roughly at what voltage. Cheap and fast — most positions resolve in a handful of shots. |
| **Slow sweep** | `--slow-sweep` | At each position, run all `--shots N` shots at the start voltage to get a real hit rate, then binary-search downward through voltage levels to find the threshold. Original legacy behavior. | High-confidence hit-rate maps when you want to know the per-cell rate at multiple voltages, not just the settle voltage. |
| **Fixed voltage** | `--fixed-voltage <V>` | Lock the CS voltage to V for every position. Take `--shots N` shots per cell at that voltage. No optimization, no drop. | Detailed maps at a known-good voltage (e.g. a threshold from a quickmap run). Same flow as the original behavior minus the optimizer. |

`--slow-sweep` and `--fixed-voltage` are mutually exclusive.

#### Output-mode flags

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--shots N` | 15 | Per-cell shot budget. Quickmap: total shots across all voltage levels (cap). Slow: shots per voltage level. Fixed: total shots per cell. |
| `--confirm N` | 5 | **Quickmap only** — consecutive `normal` results at one voltage needed to declare the cell settled. Smaller = faster but noisier; larger = more confident the voltage is safe. |
| `--no-dump` | off | Each shot only does a 4-byte test read instead of the full flash dump. Faster (`~0.5 s` per shot vs. `~2 s`) but you don't capture flash content on a successful glitch. Useful for discovery scans where finding *where* a glitch lands matters more than capturing the data. |
| `--dump-size <bytes>` | `0x7E000` (504 KB, LPC2468 user flash) | Bytes to attempt to dump on a successful glitch. The remaining 8 KB at the top of LPC2468 flash is the boot block and returns `rc=14`. |
| `--always-sync` | off | Re-`TARGET SYNC` before every shot (strict cycling). By default the script skips re-sync after a clean `normal` since the LPC bootloader stays in ISP-ready state — ~3× faster but assumes the previous shot didn't leave the chip in an unknown state. |

#### Window / position flags

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--start X Y` | `0 0` corner | Bottom-left corner of the scan window AND the spiral start point. |
| `--end X Y` | `24 24` corner | Top-right corner of the scan window. |
| `--start-x X` / `--start-y Y` | from `--start` | Override the spiral start point independently of the window. |
| `--x-min N` / `--x-max N` / `--y-min N` / `--y-max N` | from `--start`/`--end` | Restrict individual axes. |
| `--reverse` / `--forward` | forward | Direction of the spiral within the window. |
| `--trigger-byte HH` | `0D` | UART byte the PIO glitch trigger fires on. Default is `0x0D` (CR) — fires on the LPC echoing the `\r` at the end of our `R` command. |

#### Result classification on the UI

| CLI ticker | Result | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `.` | normal | rc=19 returned, CRP held |
| `!` | effect | Target perturbed, no clean rc |
| `+` | glitch | Read succeeded — bypass! Dump saved (unless `--no-dump`) |
| `S` | sync_fail | TARGET SYNC could not re-attach |
| `R` | cs_error | ChipSHOUTER fault; shot retried, doesn't count |
| `[NNNV]` | voltage drop | Quickmap mode dropped CS voltage to NNNV after a non-normal |

## Pin Configuration

### Default Pinout

- **GPIO 0 / GPIO 1** - UART0: ChipSHOUTER by default, **CLI console** with
  `-DRAIDEN_CONSOLE_UART=ON` (mutually exclusive — see below)
- **GPIO 2** - Glitch output (default)
- **GPIO 4** - Target UART TX (bootloader/bypass)
- **GPIO 5** - Target UART RX (bootloader/bypass, also PIO monitored for UART triggers)
- **GPIO 15** - Target reset / nRST (active low)

### ChipSHOUTER Connection

> **GP0/GP1 have two possible owners, never both at once.** By default they are
> the ChipSHOUTER's UART0. Built with `-DRAIDEN_CONSOLE_UART=ON` they carry the
> **CLI console** (115200 8N1, in addition to USB) and the ChipSHOUTER is
> disabled — `CS` then returns an explicit error and `PINS` / `VERSION` say so.
> Same kind of multiplexing as UART1 between Target and GRBL, except this one is
> decided at build time.

- **GPIO 0** - ChipSHOUTER UART TX
- **GPIO 1** - ChipSHOUTER UART RX
- **GPIO 2** - Hardware trigger output (connects to ChipSHOUTER trigger input)

### GRBL XY Platform Connection

- **GPIO 8** - GRBL UART TX (UART1 alternate function)
- **GPIO 9** - GRBL UART RX (UART1 alternate function)

**Note**: GRBL uses UART1 which is shared with Target UART (GP4/GP5). Only one can be active at a time - commands auto-switch as needed.

**CNC3018 Woodpecker controller wiring** (offline controller 8-pin header):
- Pico GND → controller pin 3 or 4 (GND)
- Pico GP8 (TX) → controller pin 8 (RX)
- Pico GP9 (RX) → controller pin 6 (TX)

### STM32 Attack / RDP Bypass

- **GPIO 10/11/12** - Target Power (ganged, **boot default OFF**, 12mA drive each) — *INTERNAL power mode*
- **GPIO 13** - BOOT0 control
- **GPIO 14** - BOOT1 control
- **GPIO 15** - nRST (shared with Target Reset)
- **GPIO 22** - Glitch fired / trace trigger signal (PIO output)
- **GPIO 26** - ADC power monitor (voltage sense for glitch detection)
- **GPIO 27** - ADC shunt current monitor (trace capture via ADC1)

### EXTERNAL Power / Crowbar Mode

When the GP10/11/12 group is switched to EXTERNAL mode (`TARGET POWER EXT`), the
three pins are re-tasked (they are mutually exclusive with INTERNAL power-source use):

- **GPIO 10** - Supply enable (driven by `TARGET POWER ON/OFF/CYCLE`)
- **GPIO 11** - **Crowbar gate** — PIO-driven, emits the same glitch waveform as GP2 (same
  WIDTH/GAP/COUNT timing) for any trigger type, generated by a second pulse-generator state
  machine fired from the same trigger as GP2.
  Polarity is selectable: `AHIGH` = assert HIGH / idle LOW (low-side N-FET, default);
  `ALOW` = assert LOW / idle HIGH (high-side P-FET). The gate sits at its de-asserted idle
  level at boot, while disarmed, and on disarm — so a wrong/floating idle can't clamp the rail.
- **GPIO 12** - Reserved spare (claimed, no function yet)

GP2 stays the polarity-aware glitch/trigger output throughout, so an external glitcher
(e.g. ChipSHOUTER) and the crowbar gate can be driven from the same trigger.

#### Wiring the crowbar board — GP11 is a gate, not a switch

GP11 drives a **MOSFET gate**. It is not a wire you can run straight to the rail, and the
firmware's safe idle does **not** cover the whole picture. Reference design (AO3400A,
SOT-23 — pin 1 = gate, pin 2 = source, pin 3 = drain):

- **`R_pd` = 1 kΩ, gate-to-source, mounted on the MOSFET board — mandatory.** `V_GS(th)`
  min is 0.65 V, and outside firmware control (bootrom, BOOTSEL, UF2 reflash, crash, or an
  unplugged gate wire) GP11 is an **input** — where **erratum RP2350-E9** injects up to
  120 µA. The value is bounded by `120 µA × R_pd < V_GS(th)`, **not** by `V_IL`: 1 kΩ gives
  0.12 V, while the usual 10 kΩ gives 1.2 V and the stock 8.2 kΩ E9 workaround gives 0.98 V
  — both above threshold. A floating gate is a **dead short across the rail**.
- **No gate series resistor.** The pad (~50 Ω) already over-damps the line; anything above
  ~10 Ω only slows the edge. Gate rise is `τ` ≈ 33 ns at the 12 mA drive strength that
  `target_init()` sets for the whole GP10/11/12 group.
- **`R_damp` in series with the drain** — required with a low-`R_DS(on)` part. At 19 mΩ the
  discharge mesh is heavily under-damped: the rail rings to **−2.4 V** and the peak current
  is **~8 A** (set by `V/Z0` of the LC mesh, not by the series resistor). Use
  `R_damp ≈ √(L_loop / C_residual)` — 0.15 Ω at 10 µF, 0.47 Ω at 1 µF, 1.2 Ω at 100 nF —
  and pick the value **after** measuring `C_residual`, not before.
- **1 kΩ in series with GP26/GP27.** They sit galvanically on the glitch node, which goes
  below 0 V during the pulse; RP2350 I/O absolute maximum is −0.3 V.
- **GP11 needs its own line.** Left strapped to the GP10/GP12 harness it fights GP10 (see
  `tests/test_power_mode.py`).
- Bring-up order, scope acceptance criteria and the derivation of every number above:
  `TPLink_Tapo/08_BANC_FAULTYCAT_RAIDEN.md` §4, in the parent repository.

⚠ **`WIDTH` floor in this mode.** GP2 only carries an *edge*, so `SET WIDTH 1` is fine
there — but in EXTERNAL mode GP11 carries the **real pulse width**, and two floors stack:
the gate needs ~15 cycles to reach full enhancement, and `SET WIDTH` is not monotonic
between 6 and 10 (see **Glitch Width Range** under Technical Details). Start width sweeps
at **≥ 20 cycles**.

### SWD/JTAG Debug Interface

- **GPIO 15** - nRST / TRST (shared with Target Reset)
- **GPIO 17** - SWCLK / TCK
- **GPIO 18** - SWDIO / TMS
- **GPIO 19** - TDI (JTAG only)
- **GPIO 20** - TDO (JTAG only)
- **GPIO 21** - RTCK (JTAG adaptive clocking, optional)

**Note**: SWD and JTAG share GP17/GP18. Use one interface at a time.

## Architecture

### PIO State Machines

Raiden Pico uses the RP2350's PIO for precise timing-critical operations only:

- **PIO0 SM0** - GPIO edge detection for trigger input
- **PIO0 SM1** - Glitch pulse generation (GP2 normal / GP7 inverted), cycle-accurate
- **PIO0 SM2** - UART RX decoder for byte-matching triggers (GP5); also the IRQ-trigger helper for manual `GLITCH`
- **PIO0 SM3** - Crowbar gate pulse generator (EXTERNAL mode, GP11) — a second copy of the glitch pulse program, fired from the same trigger as GP2
- **PIO1 SM0** - Clock generator (manual clock output / clock-boost)

### Hardware Peripherals

Non-timing-critical communications use standard hardware peripherals which can be shared by using alternate pin configs, 
effictively increasing the hardware UART capability from 2 to 8:

- **UART0** (GP0/GP1) - ChipSHOUTER communication (115200 baud)
- **UART1** (GP4/GP5) - Target device communication (configurable baud)
- **UART1** (GP8/GP9) - GRBL XYZ platform control

### Interrupt-Driven Design

- Target UART triggers are detected by PIO and generate IRQs
- Glitch execution happens in interrupt context for minimal latency
- Non-blocking UART reads prevent missed triggers

## Troubleshooting

### Target bootloader sync fails

LPC ISP sync typically requires 1-2 retries. Use `TARGET SYNC` which includes automatic retry logic:
```bash
TARGET LPC
TARGET SYNC 115200 12000 300
```

### No glitches generated

Check the following:
1. Is system armed? (`ARM ON`)
2. Is trigger configured? (`STATUS` to verify)
3. For GPIO triggers, is signal connected?
4. For UART triggers, is target sending data? (`DEBUG ON` to monitor)

### ChipSHOUTER not responding

1. Verify UART connection (GPIO 0/1)
2. Check baud rate (should be 115200)
3. Use `CS RESET` to reinitialize
4. Check with `CS STATUS`

### Serial device doesn't appear after flashing

If `/dev/ttyACM0` (or similar) doesn't appear after flashing, the pico-sdk may not have been installed correctly. This typically happens when git submodules weren't initialized after cloning:

```bash
cd /path/to/pico-sdk
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then rebuild and reflash the firmware.

## Technical Details

- **System Clock**: 150 MHz
- **Timing Resolution**: 6.67 ns (1 clock cycle)
- **UART Baud Rates**: Up to 921600 (configurable)
- **Glitch Width Range**: the *delivered* HIGH time is **`WIDTH + 3` cycles** below 6 and
  **`WIDTH − 2`** above (`glitch.c:376-378` subtracts 5, `glitch.pio:92-104` adds a fixed
  3), so the real minimum is **3 cycles ≈ 20 ns**, not one cycle. ⚠ The mapping is **not
  monotonic**: `WIDTH` 6…9 deliver *less* than `WIDTH` 5, and `WIDTH` 10 merely equals it.
  Upper bound is 2^32 cycles (~28.6 s) — `SET WIDTH` is unclamped.
- **Trigger Latency**: ~18 ticks (~120ns) from trigger detection to glitch output
  - This latency is automatically compensated in the PAUSE command
  - For PAUSE values >= 18, 18 ticks are subtracted to account for trigger processing
  - Example: `SET PAUSE 100` results in actual delay of 82 ticks after trigger

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Fault injection can permanently damage hardware.

- Always verify glitch parameters before arming
- Start with conservative settings (longer pause, shorter width)
- Use `GLITCH` command to test before enabling triggers
- Keep target voltage within safe operating range
- ChipSHOUTER can generate high electromagnetic fields - follow device safety guidelines
